Second Project for nano-degree

This website is called Pawfect Match. This is an idea for a company where people can enter information about themselves and the website will match them with a dog breed that best matches their personality. 

The information asked could be their age; where they live; the weather; how active they are; how much they earn; their allergies and about their family. The site would then match them to a certain dogs breed. 

The site would then link them to a local SPCA or Animal Shelter that has these dogs for adoption and the locations contact details and address. If there is nothing that matches them exactly, it will try to match something similar based on the users preferences. The next steps would be to introduce a library of all dog breeds, information could be scraped from webites with the dogs information. Form sheets would need to be created for the users to fill out also. 

There is no isntallation of other files needed to open this project. All files can be opened using a normal text editor but I do reccomend using Google Chrome to view the webpage as it was built using this. There will be no installation. 

The decided to use a navbar that was sticky, the .sticky call that is found in the CSS files are set to keep the bar at the top of the page. The navbar will allow you to move to a different part of the page when viewing a different part of the page. An example is if you are looking at the registration page but want to move to the About section the simply click About. There is a listen event added to see where the using is scrolling and an alert will appear once the user is at the bottom of the page. 

The development of the website was made to VS code and Google Chrome as their funactionalies match the best for testing. I, Euan MacQuarrie, was the only author of the file and there were no other contributors.
